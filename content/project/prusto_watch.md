*Currently an on-going project*

The Prusto Watch is an Open Source smart watch with firmware written in Rust, and PCB layout and design done in Kicad. The goal of the project is to make an fast, minimal smart watch which can be easily built by hobbyists while still looking good. This means that the user-interface must be easy to use, it is slim and low-profile, and has a battery life of about a day.

Below is a rendering from Kicad of the first iteration of the Prusto Watch PCB.
